VOID = the document was not intended to be made live. Mark the document VOID.
OBSELETE = the document is no longer required and no further revisions will ever be required.
CANCELLED = the document has been stopped and another document should be released to replace it.
SUPERCEDED = the document has been updated/amended with a new revision. Move the Superceded document to an electronic file named Superceded and make sure all copies of the original document are stamped or marked SUPERCEDED to ensure they are not used in the field.

I would suggest you never remove any of these documents - it's always best to maintain a history trail.
